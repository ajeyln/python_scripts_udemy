Udemy is one of the best online plattform to learn python language. After completion Basic knowledge on W3-School, my mind was switched to learn more on python, hence I choosed a course on Udemy named "Learn python Programming Masterclass" by Mr. Tim Buchalka.
Where he explained each concepts of Python with practical examples. The scripts in the course are advance level and it took me almost 3 months to complete.

<h2>Content :</h2>

These Scripts based mainly on 10 Python Topics.
