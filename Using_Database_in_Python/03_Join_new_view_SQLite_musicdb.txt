If we want to join 3 tables albums,songs,artists
sqlite> select artists.name,albums.name,songs.track,songs.title from songs
   ...> inner join albums on songs.album = albums._id
   ...> inner join artists on albums.artist = artists._id
   ...> order by artists.name,albums.name,songs.track,songs.track;

Creating a new table with joining 3 tables albums,songs,artists 
sqlite> create view artist_list as
   ...>  select artists.name,albums.name,songs.track,songs.title from songs
   ...>  inner join albums on songs.album = albums._id
   ...>  inner join artists on albums.artist = artists._id
   ...> order by artists.name,albums.name,songs.track;

Mini challenge
1. Select the titles of all songs on the album "Forbidden"
sqlite>select songs.title from songswhere albums.name = "forbidden" join albums on songs.album = albums._id;

2. Repeat the previous query but this timedisplay the songs in track order. you may want to include the track number in the output to verify that it worked ok.
sqlite> select songs.track,songs.title from songs join albums on songs.album = albums._id where albums.name = "Forbidden" order by songs.track;

3. Display all songs for the band "Deep Purple"
sqlite> select songs.title from songs inner join albums on songs.album = albums._id inner join artists on albums.artist= artists._id where artists.name = "Deep Purple";

4. Rename the band "Mehitabel"to "One Kitten". Note that this is an exception to the advice to always fully qualify your column names. SET artists.name won't work, you 
just need to specify name.
sqlite> update artists set name = "One Kitten" where artists.name = "Mehitabel";

5. check that the record was correctly renamed.
sqlite> select * from artists where name = "One Kitten";
3|One Kitten

6. Select the titles of all the songs by Aerosmith in alphabetical order. Include only the title in the output.
sqlite> select songs.title from songs
   ...> inner join albums on songs.album=albums._id
   ...> inner join artists on albums.artist=artists._id
   ...> where artists.name = "Aerosmith" order by songs.title;

7. Replace the column that you used in the previous answer with count(title) to get just a count of the number of songs.
sqlite> select count(songs.title) from songs
   ...> inner join albums on songs.album=albums._id
   ...> inner join artists on albums.artist=artists._id
   ...> where artists.name = "Aerosmith" ;

8. Search the internet to find out how to get a list of the songs from step 6 without any duplicates.
sqlite> select distinct songs.title from songs
   ...> inner join albums on songs.album=albums._id
   ...> inner join artists on albums.artist=artists._id
   ...> where artists.name = "Aerosmith" order by songs.title;

9. Search the internet again to find out how to get a count of the songs without duplicates.
    Hint: It uses the same keyword as step 8 but the syntax may not be obvious.
sqlite> select count(distinct songs.title) from songs
   ...> inner join albums on songs.album=albums._id
   ...> inner join artists on albums.artist=artists._id
   ...> where artists.name = "Aerosmith" order by songs.title;

10. Repeat the previous query to find the number of artists (which, obviously, should be one) and the number of albums.
sqlite> select count(distinct albums.name) from albums
   ...> inner join artists on albums.artist=artists._id
   ...> where artists.name = "Aerosmith" order by songs.title;
