Black, fertile land, 
a stretch of green leaves, and
a fest of fair flowers, my mother;
stronger with every burn,
with more suffering, 
more fruits and flowers.
kick of her kids, heavenly bliss;
resting the basket on the ground, she
groaned, closed her eyes, didn't open again.

Youth spent in tattered saris,
her hands tilled the lands,
watered the fields, and raised
pepper, jower, corns and grains;
treating her fields like tender buds,
she grew sacks full of corns
to please her man, win a hug and bracelet;

She died
with her double-bent back.
How old you think the granny was?
How many full moons did she see?
And how many times 
baked pancakes in the hot oven?
How many times did she howl over
soiled coins, festered crop and dead calf?
How many villages did she cross
looking for the lost, old buffalo?

She was no Sita,
neither Savitri nor Urmila;
no, she wasn't any holy wife – 
docile, dignified, graceful – you
find on the pages of histories and epics;
no, you can’t even compare her to 
the great wives of Gandhi and Ramakrishna;
she didn't pray, like good wife
she didn't even wear
the sacred kumkum on her face.

Like the wild bear,
she bore her kids, reared her husband,
and, saved some money for hard times;
like the hurt bitch, 
she growled and fought too;
petty, cheap, she picked faults, 
bickered like a baboon;
she did everything, to save
her house, husband, kids.
She would flare: when her son
went wayward; and her husband
sniffed here and there.

The wild bear 
needs no book of doctrines,
and none of your holy Gita; 
my mother lived for grass and grain;
for her kids and hard work;
for rice, a roof over head, 
and blanket to cover; and,
to walk equal with her peers.

To this woman, here’s some love,
praise, and tears of gratitude;
for bearing us; for rearing us;
for living in the soil; and,
for leaving us, amidst some small talks,
as casually as she would go 
from home to fields.
